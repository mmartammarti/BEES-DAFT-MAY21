# Lab | Tableau Guided Analysis with Stories- working with a dataset you know very well (your car insurance dataset, used on the labs from last week)

Build a story compiled of individual captioned storypoints in Tableau and publish the story only to your tableau public account, in order to submit the url via the Student Portal. 

Utilise the annotation and duplicate storypoint features within the Story to guide the end user through the story you want to tell with your data.  For each page of your story you should consider data visualisation best practices. 
The chart choices for each story point are up to you and be as simple or complex as you like but keep in mind that the Story is ideally consumed as a semi interactive presentation. Its ok also to include some visual imagery, external research and comments but the main focus should be on visualising observations found in the data, step by step. 

(Ensure each chart has the appropriate fit, mark type, title, axis labels and legend and that visual best practices have been considered) 


## Your challenge : 

Using the data set [marketing_customer_analysis.csv](marketing_customer_analysis.csv) 
and Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public, create a Story (at least 5 story points, but you can add more!) to take end users through the following or a similar / customised narrative: 

* 1 - overall summary / introduction to your Story or insight - ie whats something you have seen in the data you think worth telling us about?
* 2 - a view of the median customer lifetime or claim amount value broken down by chosen dimensions, such as sales channel or vehicle class
* 3-  a view revealing an overall trend / pattern observed within the dataset, perhaps reflected in correlations between measures (scatter plots) or the visual breakdown of a specific measure by dimensions (eg tree map, packed bubbles) 
* 4- a view which is related to the last view, but draws attention to an exception or outlier which stands out to you. This should be highlighted or annotated in some way. 
* 5- what do you want the end user to remember about your story (conclusion / main findings)
* use images, colour blocks of text, large font size etc where appropriate to relay your story, keeping in mind visual best practices
* the idea is that an end user can work through the tabs of the story with no intervention, and come out the other side better informed
